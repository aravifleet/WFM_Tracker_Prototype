WFM Chatbot + Activity Tracker Progress Summary (as of 2025-11-05)

✅ Completed so far:
1. Chatbot base built — prompts user at set intervals and saves responses in both .csv and .db.
2. Configurable interval — user can set prompt frequency in minutes.
3. SQLite integration — responses are saved persistently in a local DB (responses.db).
4. Status tracking added — user selects status (Working / Break / Lunch).
5. Lunch timer logic — if Lunch selected, a 30-minute timer starts and logs in DB.
6. DB schema updated — includes timestamp, response, status, and remark.
7. Currently testing:
   - Break/Lunch logic (auto timer + reminder behavior after 30 minutes).
   - Proper logging of each entry with correct timestamps and remarks.

🧩 Next Planned Enhancements:
1. If 30 mins exceeded, popup asks “Are you still on break/lunch?”
   - If Yes → mark as Lunch Exceeded by X mins
   - If No response → mark as Idle and continue tracking until user responds.
2. Silent activity tracker integration → track window titles (Chrome, VS Code, etc.) and usage duration automatically in background.
3. (Future) Admin dashboard to review employee activity (non-visible to user).
